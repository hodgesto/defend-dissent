## Framing?

When people think of activists and political dissidents under surveillance, they most likely think the source is the government at one level or another.  However, the primary opponents of many liberation-focused activists are not necessarily governments, but industries such as oil and gas, agriculture, and arms manufacturers.  These industries can afford to undertake their own surveillance and are not limited by constitutional restrictions.  We describe a small sample of capabilities that are available to industries, and for each particular threat, we describe how one could protect oneself.

#### Left out:

table of threats/capabilities vs. adversary?

* fusion centers
* information sharing between law enforcement & industry
* keep in mind that intelligence from federal agencies can be accessed by local law enforcement through information sharing particularly 
* Many of these capabilities will also be available to law enforcement agencies, although there may be limitations on what of the evidence acquire would be admissable in court
* note that corporations have access to information from commercial platforms via subpoenas, which we discuss in the context of law enforcement

##### Certificate authorities

from wikipedia "In 2011, a security breach of the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates. Subsequently, the fraudulent certificates were used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks."

fraudulent certificate issued to enable an MiTM attack:

### Security culture -- the basis of digital security 

Many digital security measures aim to protect information sharing among individuals and groups.  Most technologies can only protect privacy to the extent that the individuals in communication are trustworthy.  Any perfectly secure app or digital platforms can be defeated by an infiltrator or defector within a group.  

Social movements aware of the history of informant-driven suppression by state and private adversaries, have worked to developed what is termed "Security Culture".  This term refers to information sharing agreements and other group practices intended to minimize the negative impacts of infiltration, surveillance, and other suppressive threats to the group, its work, its membership, and broader social movements.  It is called a "Culture" since the aspiration is for principles and practices to become reflexive and intuitive.  The ideal  security culture helps a group to safely and easily communicate and grow safely, rather than become overburdened by paranoia or extensive detailed procedures and policies.

While perspepctives and practices vary widely among different groups, some important widespread practices are: (1) share information on a need-to-know basis; (2) minimize personal information that needs to be shared; (3) try to get to know the people you organize with as well as possible; (4) never brag about past actions or spread rumors.  Let's explore some of these elements in detail.

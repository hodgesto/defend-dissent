### Security culture -- the basis of digital security 

Many digital security measures aim to protect information sharing among individuals and groups.  Most technologies can only protect privacy to the extent that the individuals in communication are trustworthy.  Any perfectly secure app or digital platforms can be defeated by an infiltrator or defector within a group.  

Social movements aware of the history of informant-driven suppression by state and private adversaries, have worked to developed what is termed "Security Culture".  This term refers to information sharing agreements and other group practices intended to minimize the negative impacts of infiltration, surveillance, and other suppressive threats to the group, its work, its membership, and broader social movements.  It is called a "Culture" since the aspiration is for principles and practices to become reflexive and intuitive.  The ideal  security culture helps a group to safely and easily communicate and grow safely, rather than become overburdened by paranoia or extensive detailed procedures and policies.

While perspepctives and practices vary widely among different groups, some important widespread practices are: (1) share information on a need-to-know basis; (2) minimize the sharing of personal information; (3) get to know the people you organize with as well as possible; (4) never brag about past actions or spread rumors.  Let's explore some of these elements in detail.  

#### Need-to-know: minimize information sharing

The first principle of keeping secrets is to minmize the number of people who need to be trusted to keep them.  Of course, there is a spectrum of information sensitvity, from public announcements to open meetings, from in-development press releases to specific direct action plans.  Deciding what information needs to be protected is only part of the picture; equally, people involved in direct action social movements need to be comfortable not having access to information they don't need to do their work.

* trust the fewest possible parties.

#### Minimize personal information

Analogy to Metadata protection.

#### Vetting and trust building

Build trust over time.

#### Bragging and gossip

Authenticity of information.

### Limits of technology -- endpoint security

* Closed source:
    ** hardware
    ** firmware
    ** microcode
    ** drivers
* Compiler bugs
* Zero days

### What you can do

* from CLDC posts
* limit how much you post online, consider your privacy settings and geolocation settings (but understand that the policies of the companies that hold your data can change)
* Meet in person to share crucial/high-risk info
* Use obfuscation in addition to encryption for crucial/high-risk info that must be shared online


### What does this protect me from? 

* social media monitoring
* subpoenas and search warrants
* doxxing

## Overview: defenses against digital threats

where your data can be (figure and explanation: head -> phone/computer -> cable/wifi/cell -> ISP -> cloud)

who are your adversaries? 
* hierarchy of capability
* threat = capability x effort/risk of discovery

overview of the forthcoming parts
* Security culture / minimal data [security-culture.md]
* Protect your devices / data with you [devices.md]
* Protect your communications / data in the wild [comms.md]
* Getting away with it: anonymity, pseudonymity, and anti-censorship [apac.md]

each section will:
* give more detail of how your data is handled
* describe how to protect yourself/what you can and should do
* what this will protect you from (specific attacks/known adversaries & capabilities)
  * range of stories covering different adversaries because what you can do to protect yourself from the government may also protect you from a neighborhood nazi

* nothing will protect you 100%
* but we can protect communities
* always consider organizing offline
* the infrastructure is hostile to you

When people think of activists and political dissidents under surveillance, they most likely think the source is the government at one level or another.  However, the primary opponents of many liberation-focused activists are not necessarily governments, but industries such as oil and gas, agriculture, and arms manufacturers.  These industries can afford to undertake their own surveillance and are not limited by constitutional restrictions.  We describe a small sample of capabilities that are available to industries, and for each particular threat, we describe how one could protect oneself.

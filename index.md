## Table of Contents

[//]: (in accordance with the orignal book proposal, future revisions of this text will add feature Part 0/Preface: History of Surveillance Abuses and possibly Part III: expanded Countermeasures)

This open textbook can be read linearly -- cryptography fundamentals followed by their application in threats to social movement groups and available countermeasures.  Alternative reading sequences will be made available as "playlists" in future revisions to the text (e.g. the order presented in-class in CS175 at OSU; suggested sequences for social movement groups or digital security trainers).

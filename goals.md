## Goals 

Here we discuss what we are trying to achieve in our discussion of communications security for liberatory social movements.

#### What does Security mean?  What is the goal of Communications/Digital Security?

Security is a subjective, multifactored, complex, and gendered concept.  Security can be thought of as both a subjective feeling of being free of or protected against threats and having protected space to carry out work.

This topic has been explored in great detail for two groups: journalists and human rights workers, focusing especially on those working in areas where political violence is commonplace (e.g. [Holistic Security](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/).  Likewise there are considerable resources available to these groups (e.g. [Access Now](https://accessnow.org), Freedom of the Press Foundation, Security in a Box, etc.).  In the same vein, digital threats focus on overtly authoritarian states (see many excellent investigations and reports by [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca)).

For social movements based in the United States of America, where political expression and activity have a high degree of formal protection, resources exist but are somewhat more fragmentary and focus on communities of color and more radical environmental and social justice groups, all whom have experienced many decades of varying degrees of police violence and state suppression.

Since many excellent resources on tools and countermeasures exist and can be adapted for use from guides written for journalists and human rights workers, we will focus here on foundations of cryptography and digital communications, and attempt to delineate the scope and specific capabilities of threats to US-based social movements.  We anticipate that many of these lessons will be applicable to individuals in similar (e.g. OECD) countries.

#### Understanding threats

Digital threat modeling--understanding what information or communications need to be protected, who they need to be protected from, and the degree of harm if they are compromised--is the starting point of most approaches to digital security.  Comprehending the full range of digital threats available to adversaries is difficult enough--realistically assessing the likelihood 

This is covered in detail in the [Threat overview](threat-overview.md) section.



#### Countermeasures

While we won't spend much time listing specific "secure" apps, technologies, and platforms (since this work is well done elsewhere) we will explore fundamental properties of security-enhancing technologies and choices.

1. Minimize the number of **trusted** platforms, apps, devices, and people.  In contrast, **trustworthy** entities are essential to community organizing and should be embraced and nurtured!  But make technological and operational choices that *require* the trust of as few as possible--since each **trusted** entity represents a possible point of compromise.

1. Use [open source](modern-cryptography.md) apps whenever possible.

### Overview

Using Tor it is possible to conceal your identity online from [most adversaries](threat-overview.md) and even enjoy significant protection against a [nation-state level adversary](threat-state.md), with only a few known exceptions.  There are important warnings and caveats, however: **remember, unless you cannot avoid it, never entrust your life or freedom entirely to ~~a complex machine you cannot fully control~~ a computer**.

### Warning: Situations in which Tor cannot protect you

If an adversary (Edgar) is able to watch Assata's connection to the Tor network as well her connection leaving the Tor network (to Bobby's website), Edgar will be able to determine that Assata is visiting Bobby's website.  This is called an [*end-to-end timing* or *correlation* attack].  Also, if you attempt to use applications not designed for Tor over the Tor network, they may leak identifying information.

### Getting Tor

Download Tor Browser from [the Tor Project website](https://www.torproject.org/).  For maximum safety, in particular if you consider yourself or your organization subject to targeted attack, [verify the PGP signature of the downloaded file](https://www.torproject.org/).  See [end-to-end encryption](end-to-end-encryption.md) and [GPG](GPG.md) for background.


### Different ways to use Tor

Here are some use cases:

1. **Anonymous browsing** - Don't log in to any websites, ideally make a new identity to separate top secret research);

1. **Pseudonymous posting** - Use an identitito post press releases/participate in forums/online discussions (never log in to a service outside of tor, greater caution required the longer a secret identity needs to be maintained);

1. **Hide your physical location** - Non-anonymous use of personal/organizational social media, to conceal physical location from the social media platform;

1. **Top secret chats** - between people who know each other (needs some additional, Tor-safe chat program like xmpp/pidgin/gajim, tor messenger, tox, riot.im)
